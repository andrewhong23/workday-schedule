## Description


This is a password generator that will provide a password of any given length, with any provided criteria that the user wants.  This was built in the idea that users are going to want a secure password that is not easily hacked or detected.  By randomizing the criteria, this will give one password out of thousands of options for optimal security.  This project was built using JavaScript code and syntax.  More specifically "for loops" and "if statements."
